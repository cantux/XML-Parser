example usage:

./xmlreport asdf --version --element:cost --element:company --element:name --print-all

thought of printing our element names and use std::cin to take names one by one before generating a report.

Hi Colin,

I spent some time to put comments to the headers. Can you put some pointers for writing better comments please. You can put //CG: and some explanation on how to make it better.
